name = input("Enter your full name: ")

# get the name, put it into a list, and then seperates it by each index and 
# put it into another list and then get the first letter using word

#puts the name given into a list and seperates it into seperate strings
a = name.split()

# seperates strings into it's own list
first_name = a[0]
middle_name = a[1]
last_name = a[2]

# takes the letter from the name list and now gets the first letter of each name
fn_letter = first_name[0]
mn_letter = middle_name[0]
ln_letter = last_name[0]

# gives them the appropriate upper or lowercase letter

lower_middle = mn_letter.lower()
upper_last = ln_letter.upper()


#outputs monogram of given name

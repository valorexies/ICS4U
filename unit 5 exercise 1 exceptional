def standard_deviation():
    """ finds the standard deviation and average of 150 random integers from 25 to 75.
    this is done by generating random numbers and adding them into a list 
    then we add them up and divide by 150 to get the average
    after we want to find the squared differences so we find the difference between each number and square it
    we then find the average of the squared differences and square root it. 

    Args: 
    def standard_deviation() - finds the standard deviation of numbers given
    numbers = [] - a list that holds all the integer values
    u - the average of all the numbers randomly generated
    v - the average of the squared differences
    standard_deviation - the standard deviation 
    above_expectional - numbers above the average and standard deviation added together
    lower_exceptional - numbers below the average and standard deviation subtracted together

    Assumption: 

    Returns: u, the average, and standard_deviation, the standard deviation of the numbers

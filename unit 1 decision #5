Fractions are represented as an integer numerator over an integer denominator. Recall
that improper fractions have a numerator greater than denominator, and mixed
fractions is a whole number combined with a proper fraction.

To change an improper fraction into a mixed fraction, you can use integer division and
the remainder operator (modulo). Write a program that will allow the user to enter two
integer values, a numerator and denominator. The program should output these values
as an improper fraction, and then output the equivalent mixed fraction.

For example:
Enter the numerator: 8
Enter the denominator: 3
8 / 3 is equivalent to 2 and 2 / 3

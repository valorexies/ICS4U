5. Write a program that solves a quadratic equation in standard form using the
quadratic formula. You may look this up to refresh your memory. Check if the
equation has zero, one, or two solutions first, using the discriminant, and then
output any solutions (if there are any).

#input - get the quadratic equation and formula
import math
a = int(input("Input a: "))
b = int(input("Input b: "))
c = int(input("Input c: "))

#process - determine how many solutions the equation has (the discriminant)
#when discriminant is found, continue with quadractic formula calculations
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

# 0 - repeated real number solution
if discriminant == 0:
    x = (-b + math.sqrt(b ** 2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
    #output
    print("There is 1 real number solution: ", x1)

#even - 2 real number solution
elif discriminant > 0:
    x1 = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
    x2 = (-b - math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
    #output
    print("there are 2 real number solutions: ", x1, "and", x2)
    
#odd - no real number solution 
else:
    #output
    print("There are no real number solutions")

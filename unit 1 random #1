1. Use the random module to simulate each scenario.

A. Simulate the sum of the rolls of two dice, by generating a random number between
2 and 12.
B. Simulate the sum of the rolls of two dice, by generating two random numbers
between 1 and 6, then adding them.
C. Explain how the two scenarios above are different, even though they result in the same values.

#a
from random import*
a1 = randint(2, 12)
a2 = randint(2, 12)

#b
from random import*
b1 = randint(1, 6)
b2 = randint(1, 6)
sum_b = b1 + b2

#output
print("The answer for a is", a1,"and", a2)
print("The sum of", b1, "and", b2, "is", sum_b)

#c
#while in both A and B we are generating 2 random numbers between a certain interval, in B we are adding them together.
#the main difference is that you can't change the value in A but in B you can because it gets added together.

#determines the probability if n amount of people have the same birthday

#input - input the amount of people there are to calculate

import math

n = int(input("Amount of people are in the room: "))

#process - processes the loop to calculate the probability 
def birthday(n):
    probability = 1
    # n==1 is an automatic 0, there is no probablitity of sharing the same bday if there's only 1 person in the room
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        for y in range (n):
            # the *= tells the program multiply y with the answer from the previous loop 
            probability *= ((365 - y)/365)
        return probability

p = birthday(n)
final_prob = (1- p) * 100

#output - tells the user the answer 
print("In this room of ", n, " people, the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday is: ", (round(final_prob, 2)), "%")
print("For a 50% probability, the minimum amount of people needed is: 23")
